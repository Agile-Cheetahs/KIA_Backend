This git repository has been created for the back-end side programming of **"Kitchen Inventory Application (KIA)"** project.

"CSC 536: Software Engineering" course project, The University of Arizona, Dr. Ravi Sethi, Spring 2024

**"Kitchen Inventory Application"** is a comprehensive web application, that transforms kitchen management into a seamless experience. It's more than a list; it's a smart assistant that optimizes inventory use, suggests recipes based on available ingredients, and features a smart grocery list to prevent oversights. With innovative tools like a barcode scanner, expiration tracking, and cooking habit insights, our app aims to reduce food waste, save time, and enhance the cooking and shopping experience by making it efficient and enjoyable.
